# menigame-example
An example of a web minigame built in JS and C compiled to WASM.

I've adapted this from the code I use for my minigames at https://joshpowlison.com/minigames

This is made primarily to help teach others how to make web games using C compiled to WASM.

## Getting Started
1. Download and install LLVM (go down to Pre-Built Binaries) https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#11.0.1
	- When installing, add LLVM to the system PATH for all users
	
2. Run XAMPP or other webhost software supporting PHP
